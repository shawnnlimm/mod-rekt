# ModRekt

## Proposed Level of Achivement

Apollo

## Motivation

During ModReg, many students have modules that they would like to enroll in with their friends and would like to attend the same tutorial slot together. However, there are often clashes with our own preferred timetable, making it difficult and troublesome to find a possible schedule to achieve both aims. It will be convenient to have a tool for students to view their friends’ timetables, making it more convenient for them to plan their own timetables.

## Aim

We hope to make it convenient for students to find a suitable timetable such that they can attend the same tutorial slots with their friends. Our system aims to help to allow students to view their friends’ timetables and suggest changes, also allowing them to view students that are bidding for the same tutorial slot.

## User Stories

1. As a student, I want to be able to take the same tutorial slots as my friends despite us having different preferences in tutorial timings

2. As a student, I want to be able to see my friends’ tabletables to make it convenient for me to plan mine and attend the same tutorials with them

3. As a student, I want to be able to plan my timetable in advance so that I can manage my time better

4. As a student I want to at least have a friend to accompany me during tutorial slots if none of my friend circle are attending the same slot as me.

5. As a student, I want to see the number of people and people who are interested in bidding for the same tutorial slot as me so that I can gauge my chances of getting the tutorial slot.
